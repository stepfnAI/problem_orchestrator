üöÄ Getting Started

**Prerequisites**

- Python 3.9-3.11
- OpenAI API key

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stepfnAI/problem_orchestrator.git
cd problem_orchestrator
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment using virtualenv:

```bash
pip install virtualenv                # Install virtualenv if not already installed
virtualenv venv                       # Create virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate             # Linux/Mac
# OR
.\venv\Scripts\activate              # Windows
```

3. Install the package in editable mode:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up your OpenAI API key:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your_openai_api_key'
```

üîÑ Pipeline Workflow

1. **Start the Application**

```bash
# Windows
streamlit run .\orchestration\main_orchestration.py

# Linux/Mac
streamlit run orchestrator/app.py
```


2. **Follow the Step-by-Step Process**:
   - Upload your data files
   - Confirm automatic categorization
   - Review and adjust column mappings
   - Configure data cleaning rules
   - Set up aggregation preferences
   - Validate and execute data joins
   - Configure and execute data splitting
   - Train and evaluate models
   - Select best performing model
   - Run inference on new data
