The code must create these EXACT variables:\n   a. metrics: dict containing:\n      * 'roc_auc': ROC AUC score\n      * 'precision': Precision score\n      * 'recall': Recall score\n      * 'f1': F1 score\n      * 'confusion_matrix': Confusion matrix as list of lists\n   b. model: The trained model object\n   c. training_features: list of column names used for training\n\n2. Code Guidelines:\n   - First check each feature's dtype using train_df[column].dtype\n   - Use ONLY features that are numeric (int, float) or boolean\n   - Skip any columns that are: object, datetime, period, or other non-numeric types\n   - Get target values directly using train_df[target_column] and valid_df[target_column]\n   - IMPORTANT: Check if target has at least two unique classes in both train and valid sets\n   - If not enough classes, raise ValueError with clear message\n   - Handle class imbalance using model's built-in parameters:\n     * XGBoost: scale_pos_weight\n     * LightGBM: is_unbalance=True\n     * Random Forest: class_weight='balanced'\n     * CatBoost: auto_class_weights=True\n   - Use train_df for training and valid_df for metrics calculation\n   - IMPORTANT: Save the trained model object in a variable named 'model'\n   - IMPORTANT: Save the list of used features in a variable named 'training_features'\n\n3. Available variables:\n   - train_df, valid_df: Training and validation DataFrames\n   - Model imports: XGBClassifier, LGBMClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, CatBoostClassifier\n   - Metric imports: roc_auc_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score, confusion_matrix\n   - pd, np: Standard modules\n\nProvide response in JSON format:\n{{\n    \"code\": \"<your code here>\",\n    \"explanation\": \"Brief explanation of the approach\"\n}}"
